Who Venture Capitals are and how they invest.
Have you participated in ICO,IDO,IEO or private sales to date? Have you met successful people who have invested?
High-risk risky investors; Do you know those so-called millionaire investors?
Let's start with people who are Venture Capital investors, these people receive digital assets at a much lower price and better than what is offered to the public and sell it to the public at a higher price! Owners of digital assets around the world have ambiguities that open up private sales to richer and more powerful people, allowing them to increase their wealth and power.
In this here, we are going to talk a little bit about VCs and private sales that are happening in the digital currency world, and finally reach the goal of Metaverse MGL.
Let's start by talking about venture capitalists and see who they really are.
In general, venture capitalists are individuals who raise the initial capital to finance digital currency projects in the early stages.
These people take the tokens at a very low price for themselves or their investors and thus secure and increase the capital.
The main work of VCs:
Find projects
Negotiate privately
Funding for the project
Buy digital assets at a very low price
take of profit.
It is good to know that most digital currency projects have already sold some currencies to these VC before starting work and announcing the existence and sale of their tokens to the public in order to provide the necessary budget for hiring people and starting the project; To be honest, people do not do work for free, so these investors will eventually add to their wealth by preparing this budget and starting the project.
So VCs fund projects and make huge profits for doing nothing.
Unfortunately, VCs have recently moved on to new ventures.
With the increase in trading volume and the high penetration rate of digital currencies and the increase in the volume of capital, VCs that used to buy only tokens at a lower price and sell at a higher price; Recently, they also have the plan of the projects and how to distribute the tokens and how to list and sell them.
if you look closely, many digital currency projects have started with a lot of noise, and in the exchanges listed and the price has suddenly dropped sharply.
Here, the unfair distribution and greed of VCs cause ordinary buyers to buy currencies at a much higher price, and ultimately it is these VCs that suddenly drop the price by selling tokens.
We can mention this example to ICP or other projects that were bought by ordinary buyers at a very high price, and finally CVs sell their tokens at a high price and suddenly.
Metaverse MGL has started with the decision to distribute tokens fairly and has not had any sales before.
Finally we decided to start the Genesis project without the capital of VCs;  Fortunately, one of the most important steps in this preparation has been the Metaverse MGL team; We were able to form ateam of friends to take a big step towards independence from VCs.
MGL's goal is to distribute MGLC tokens fairly to people, we even have a plan that if people do not succeed in buying tokens in our sales plan, we will not have a sharp price reduction after MGLC tokens are listed in exchange .
For more information, I have to say that unlike most new projects that initially sell the bulk of the tokens, Metaverse MGL has locked 60% of the MGLC tokens for its ecosystem and the Genesis land and which are not for sale.to get you You have to work in Genesis and get these tokens and then you can sell your tokens in Genesis or in exchange.
This is the biggest step of MGL to control the price of MGLC tokens. Next, I have to say that the MGL sales program for selling tokens is done in three stages before being listed. In order to control the price until we reach a suitable penetration factor in the market, the distribution of purchased tokens will be in stages.
In order to have a fair distribution, we have included VCs in the sales program like other users, without considering any special privileges or even separate coupons for them.
We hope that with the fair distribution of MGLC tokens and Genesis lands, everyone will use Genesis, as we said, this land belongs to you and we will do our best for your independence from this land.
